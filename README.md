# Unity-RPG-Game-Test
Little challenge to create rpg game in Unity game engine. It's was done to remember making games in Unity.
I tried to do as much as possible in one week, unfortunately at the expense of the aesthetics of the code.
# Controls:

**WASD** -> movement

**Mouse** -> camera left and right movement

**Left mouse button** -> strong attack (30% crit chance, but single target)

**Right mouse button** -> wirl attack (can hit multiple targets)

**E** -> Block (if well-timed, it reduces the damage taken by half)

**Space** -> Hold while walking to use portal and enter boss room.
